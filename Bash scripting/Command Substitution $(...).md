# 🔹 Command Substitution `$(...)` in Bash — Deep Dive

---

## **1. The Core Concept**

Command substitution replaces `$(command)` with the **stdout** (standard output) of `command`.  
It runs the command in a **subshell** (a child process created by Bash).

Example:

```bash
user=$(whoami) 
echo "Current user: $user"
```

- `whoami` runs.
    
- Its stdout (`alice`) is captured.
    
- `$user` becomes `"alice"`.
    

---

## **2. Why `$(...)` Instead of Backticks**

Older shells used backticks:

```bash
user=`whoami` 
```

Problems:

- Nesting is messy (you must escape backticks).
    
- Less readable.
    

`$(...)` fixes both:

```bash
outer=$(echo "outer $(echo inner)")
```

---

## **3. Subshell Behavior**

Every command substitution runs in a **separate process**:

- Variable assignments don’t persist.
    
- `cd` doesn’t persist.
    
- Traps, `umask`, limits, etc. don’t propagate.
    

Example:

```bash
var=1 
echo $(var=99; echo $var)   # prints 99 
echo $var                   # still 1
```

---

## **4. Output Rules**

- **Captures stdout only**:
    

```bash
out=$(ls /nosuch 2>/dev/null)   # silence stderr
```

- **Trailing newlines are stripped**:
    

```bash
out=$(printf "a\nb\n\n\n") 
printf '[%s]\n' "$out" 
# prints: 
# [a 
# b]
```

- **Internal newlines are preserved**:
    

```bash
out=$(printf "a\nb\nc\n") 
echo "$out" 
# a 
# b 
# c
```

- **No NUL bytes**: Bash strings can’t contain `\0`. Binary outputs get truncated.
    

---

## **5. Quoting & Word Splitting**

Quoting is the biggest pitfall.

### Without quotes:

```bash
files=$(ls *.txt) 
for f in $files; do   # word-splitting on IFS   
	echo "File: $f" 
done
```

- Splits on whitespace.
    
- Breaks with spaces/newlines in filenames.
    

### With quotes:

```bash
files="$(ls *.txt)" 
 echo "$files"   # preserved exactly (with newlines)
```

**Rule of thumb:**  
👉 Always quote `$(...)` unless you explicitly want word-splitting and globbing.

---

## **6. Exit Status**

- The exit code of the **last command** inside the substitution is available via `$?`.
    

```bash
$(false) 
echo $?   # 1
```

- If substitution is in an assignment:
    

```bash
val=$(grep "foo" file.txt) 
echo $?   # grep’s exit code
```

---

## **7. Capturing Both stdout and stderr**

- Capture **stdout + stderr**:
    

```bash
out=$(command 2>&1)
```

- Capture stdout separately, stderr to file:
    

```bash
out=$(command 2>err.log)
```

- Capture stderr separately:
    

```bash
err=$( (command) 2>&1 1>/dev/null )
```

---

## **8. Performance Considerations**

- Command substitution **buffers the entire output into memory**.  
    Don’t use it for very large data streams.
    

Bad:

```bash
all=$(cat hugefile)   # loads whole file into memory
```

Better: use a loop or process substitution:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line; do   
	process "$line" 
done < hugefile
```

Or:

```bash
diff <(sort file1) <(sort file2)
```

---

## **9. Preserving Newlines & Exact Output**

Problem: trailing newlines are stripped.

### Workaround: sentinel

```bash
out=$(command; printf "_SENTINEL_") 
out=${out%_SENTINEL_}
```

### Workaround: file

```bash
command >tmpfile mapfile -t arr < tmpfile
```

---

## **10. Command Substitution in Arrays**

To safely capture multiple lines into an array:

```bash
mapfile -t arr < <(command) 
for item in "${arr[@]}"; do   
	echo "$item" 
done
```

- Preserves spaces.
    
- Preserves newlines (without trailing newline stripping issues).
    
- Avoids word-splitting mess.
    

---

## **11. Nested Substitution**

Nest freely:

```bash
echo "Now: $(echo $(date +%H:%M))"
```

More practical:

```bash
user=$(id -un) 
groups=$(id -Gn $(id -un)) 
echo "User: $user" 
echo "Groups: $groups"
```

---

## **12. Advanced Tricks**

### Inline arithmetic with substitution

```bash
lines=$(wc -l < file.txt) 
echo "Next line: $((lines + 1))"
```

### Conditional default

```bash
val=$(somecmd || echo "default")
```

### Prompt customization

```bash
PS1="[\u@\h $(date +%H:%M)]\$ "
```

### Safe reads

```bash
read -r firstline < <(head -n1 file.txt)
```

---

## **13. Pitfalls & Gotchas**

- ❌ Don’t parse `ls` with substitution → use globbing:
    
    ```bash
    for f in *.txt; do echo "$f"; done
    ```
    
- ❌ Beware stripping newlines if you need exact output.
    
- ❌ Huge outputs = memory hog.
    
- ❌ Don’t expect variable changes inside substitution to persist.

# 🔹 Wrap-Up

- `$(...)` = runs in subshell, captures **stdout**, strips **trailing newlines**.
    
- Quote it almost always: `var="$(cmd)"`.
    
- Use process substitution `<(...)` for **streams**, not captured strings.
    
- Use `mapfile` or `while read -r` for **arrays/lines**, not `for i in $(cmd)`.
    

Together, these make `$(...)` one of the **most powerful but subtle Bash features**.
