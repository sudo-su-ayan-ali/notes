- `pwd`  –  Print Working Directory
	Think of this as asking, “Where the heck am I right now?”
	It shows you the exact path of your current location in the filesystem.

- `ls` –  List
	Displays all files and folders in the current directory.
	Add options like ls -l (long format info) or ls -a (shows hidden files, which true hackers love). Combine them: ls -la.

- `cd` –  Change Directory
	Moves you around the file system.
	Example: cd Documents dives into the Documents folder; cd .. moves you one layer back.

- `touch` –  Create empty file
	Like conjuring a blank document instantly. Example: touch notes.txt.

- `mkdir` –  Make Directory
	Summon a brand-new folder. Example: mkdir projects.

- `rm` –  Remove
	Deletes files. Handle with care—it doesn’t politely ask, "Are you sure?" unless you add flags.
	rm file.txt deletes a file, rm -r folder recursively deletes a folder and its guts (the “scorched earth” option).

- `cp` –  Copy
	Duplicates files or folders. Example: cp old.txt backup.txt.

- `mv` – Move or Rename
	Shifts files around or simply renames them. Example: mv draft.txt final.txt.
