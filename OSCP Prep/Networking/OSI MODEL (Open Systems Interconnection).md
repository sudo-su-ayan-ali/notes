# 🌐 OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)

**Definition:**  
A conceptual 7-layer networking model developed by ISO (International Organization for Standardization) that standardizes functions of communication systems, ensuring interoperability between different products and software, by dividing networking tasks into **layers with defined responsibilities.**

## 🧩 OSI Layers and Their Definitions

1. **Physical Layer (L1):**  
    Defines the physical medium for raw bit transmission (cables, radio waves, voltages, light pulses).
    
2. **Data Link Layer (L2):**  
    Ensures reliable transmission over a single link by handling MAC addresses, error detection, and framing.
    
3. **Network Layer (L3):**  
    Provides logical addressing (IP addresses) and determines the best path (routing) for data across interconnected networks.
    
4. **Transport Layer (L4):**  
    Manages end-to-end communication, error recovery, and flow control between devices (TCP, UDP).
    
5. **Session Layer (L5):**  
    Establishes, maintains, and terminates sessions (logical dialogues) between applications.
    
6. **Presentation Layer (L6):**  
    Formats, encrypts, compresses, or translates data for application use (e.g., encryption via TLS, character encoding).
    
7. **Application Layer (L7):**  
    Provides network services directly to users or applications (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS).
