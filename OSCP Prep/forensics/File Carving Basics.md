# File Carving Basics (Pentester-Focused Deep Dive)

File carving is a **forensic and offensive technique used to extract files from raw data without relying on a filesystem structure**.

In simple terms:

> 🪓 File carving recovers files from raw disk, memory, or firmware images by identifying file signatures (magic bytes).

It is heavily used in:

* Digital forensics
* Incident response
* Firmware analysis
* Disk exploitation
* Memory analysis
* CTFs
* Data recovery

---

# 1. Why File Carving Is Important in Pentesting

During engagements you may encounter:

* Raw disk images (`.dd`, `.img`)
* Memory dumps
* Corrupted filesystems
* Embedded firmware blobs
* Deleted files
* Slack space artifacts
* Unallocated disk space

File carving allows you to:

✔ Recover deleted documents
✔ Extract credentials from unallocated space
✔ Recover embedded payloads
✔ Extract hidden data from firmware
✔ Recover malware from memory dumps

# 2. Core Concept: How File Carving Works

File carving does **not** rely on:

* File allocation tables
* Inodes
* MFT (Master File Table)
* Directory structure

Instead, it relies on:

### 🔎 1. File Signatures (Magic Bytes)

Every file type starts with a unique byte pattern.

Examples:

| File Type | Header (Hex) | Footer (Hex)      |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------------- |
| JPEG      | FF D8 FF     | FF D9             |
| PNG       | 89 50 4E 47  | IEND              |
| PDF       | 25 50 44 46  | %%EOF             |
| ZIP       | 50 4B 03 04  | 50 4B 05 06       |
| ELF       | 7F 45 4C 46  | (no fixed footer) |

Carving engines:

1. Scan raw data for header
2. Identify footer (if exists)
3. Extract everything in between

# 3. When File Carving Is Used

## 3.1 Deleted File Recovery

When a file is deleted:

* Data often remains on disk
* Only metadata pointers are removed
* Carving can recover the content

---

## 3.2 Memory Forensics

Example:

* Dumped RAM
* Malware injected into memory
* Extract PE files or shellcode

---

## 3.3 Firmware Analysis

Firmware may contain:

* Embedded PNGs
* Config backups
* Web server files
* Hidden archives

Carving extracts them even without known filesystem structures.

---

## 3.4 Malware Analysis

Packed malware often embeds:

* Secondary payloads
* Encrypted config
* Hidden PE files

Carving helps extract them.

---

# 4. Basic Carving Workflow

## Step 1 – Obtain Raw Data

Examples:

```bash
dd if=/dev/sda of=disk.img bs=4M
```

Or:

* Memory dump (`.raw`)
* Firmware blob (`firmware.bin`)
* Network capture converted to raw stream

---

## Step 2 – Identify File Signatures

Use:

```bash
binwalk disk.img
```

or

```bash
strings disk.img
```

---

## Step 3 – Carve Files

### Using Foremost

```bash
foremost -i disk.img -o output/
```

---

### Using Scalpel

```bash
scalpel disk.img -o output/
```

---

### Using Binwalk (firmware-focused)

```bash
binwalk -e disk.img
```

---

# 5. Manual File Carving (Understanding the Internals)

Suppose you find a JPEG header at offset 20480.

Extract manually:

```bash
dd if=disk.img of=image.jpg bs=1 skip=20480 count=50000
```

This method is useful when:

* Tools fail
* Signatures are corrupted
* You need precision extraction

---

# 6. Common File Carving Tools

## 🔹 Foremost

* Header/footer based
* Configurable signatures
* Good for disk images

---

## 🔹 Scalpel

* Improved version of Foremost
* More configurable
* Faster

---

## 🔹 Binwalk

* Best for firmware
* Handles embedded filesystems
* Recursive extraction

---

## 🔹 Bulk Extractor

* Extracts emails, URLs, credit cards
* Does not rely on file structure
* Great for IR

---

## 🔹 PhotoRec

* Strong recovery tool
* Ignores filesystem
* Works on many file types

---

# 7. Challenges in File Carving

## 7.1 Fragmented Files

If a file is fragmented:

* Header and footer may not be contiguous
* Carving may fail
* Partial recovery possible

---

## 7.2 False Positives

Random data may match a signature.

Example:

* Random bytes match JPEG header pattern

Always verify carved files.

---

## 7.3 Encrypted or Compressed Data

High entropy regions may:

* Hide files
* Prevent carving
* Require decompression first

---

# 8. Advanced Techniques

## 8.1 Entropy Analysis

Detect suspicious areas:

```bash
binwalk -E disk.img
```

High entropy = encrypted/compressed payload

---

## 8.2 Custom Signature Creation

Scalpel config example:

```
jpg     y       2000000     \xff\xd8\xff     \xff\xd9
```

You can define:

* Header
* Footer
* Max file size

---

## 8.3 XOR / Obfuscation Recovery

If data is XOR’d:

* Detect repeating patterns
* Use CyberChef or scripts
* Deobfuscate before carving

---

# 9. File Carving vs Filesystem Recovery

| Filesystem Recovery | File Carving           |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Uses metadata       | Ignores metadata       |
| Faster              | Slower                 |
| Needs intact FS     | Works on damaged disks |
| Accurate filenames  | Usually generic names  |

---

# 10. Red Team vs Blue Team Use

## 🔴 Red Team

* Recover credentials from images
* Extract deleted configs
* Recover staged malware
* Pull keys from memory dumps

---

## 🔵 Blue Team

* Incident response
* Recover deleted attacker tools
* Extract malware artifacts
* Forensic analysis

---

# 11. Real-World Pentest Example

### Scenario: Compromised Linux Server

You obtain:

```
/dev/sda
```

You image disk.

Run:

```bash
foremost -i disk.img -o recovered/
```

You recover:

* `/recovered/jpg/00000012.jpg`
* `/recovered/pdf/00000003.pdf`
* `/recovered/zip/00000008.zip`

Inside zip:

* `.ssh/id_rsa`
* Database backups

This can escalate impact significantly.

# 12. Indicators of Interesting Findings

Look for:

* `.pem`
* `.key`
* `shadow`
* `config.php`
* `.env`
* Wallet files
* SSH keys
* Browser password DBs

---

# 13. Practical Lab Exercise Idea

1. Create a file
2. Delete it
3. Image disk
4. Carve it back

You’ll understand carving deeply by doing it.
