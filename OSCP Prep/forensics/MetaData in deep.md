## What “metadata” means in forensics

Metadata is **data about data**. In forensics, it’s valuable because it can answer:

- **Who** created or modified something
    
- **When** it was created, accessed, moved, or altered
    
- **Where** it came from (device, software, GPS, network)
    
- **How** it was handled (apps, OS, transfer methods)
    

Think of metadata as the **timeline + context layer** behind digital evidence.

## Core categories of forensic metadata

### 1. File system metadata (very important)

Found at the OS / disk level.

**Common fields**

- MAC times:
    
    - **M**odified (content changed)
        
    - **A**ccessed (opened/read)
        
    - **C**reated (created on that file system)
        
- File size
    
- File path
    
- File permissions / ownership
    
- Inode / MFT record numbers
    

**Forensic value**

- Timeline reconstruction
    
- Detecting file copying vs original creation
    
- Identifying anti-forensic behavior (timestomping)
    

**Examples**

- NTFS (Windows): `$MFT`, `$LogFile`
    
- EXT4 (Linux): inodes
    
- APFS / HFS+ (macOS)

### 2. Application-level metadata

Stored _inside_ the file itself.

**Examples**

- Documents (Word, PDF):
    
    - Author
        
    - Company
        
    - Revision history
        
    - Software version
        
- Images (EXIF):
    
    - Camera make/model
        
    - Date/time
        
    - GPS coordinates
        
    - Editing software
        
- Videos:
    
    - Encoding tool
        
    - Frame rate changes
        
    - Creation vs render time
        

**Forensic value**

- Attribution (who likely created it)
    
- Detecting edits or manipulation
    
- Linking files to specific users or devices

### 3. OS & user activity metadata

Generated by normal system use.

**Examples**

- Windows:
    
    - Registry keys
        
    - Prefetch files
        
    - Jump lists
        
    - LNK (shortcut) files
        
- macOS:
    
    - Spotlight metadata
        
    - Quarantine events
        
- Linux:
    
    - Bash history
        
    - Log files
        

**Forensic value**

- Proving execution of programs
    
- User behavior analysis
    
- Corroborating timelines

### 4. Network & communication metadata

Metadata without content — still very powerful.

**Examples**

- IP addresses
    
- Timestamps
    
- Ports & protocols
    
- Email headers
    
- Call/message logs
    

**Forensic value**

- Identifying communication patterns
    
- Linking devices or accounts
    
- Geolocation (approximate)
    

---

### 5. Cloud & mobile metadata

Huge in modern cases.

**Examples**

- File sync times (Google Drive, iCloud)
    
- Device IDs
    
- App install/update times
    
- GPS & sensor logs
    
- Backup metadata
    

**Forensic value**

- Cross-device correlation
    
- Proving possession or access
    
- Filling gaps when data is deleted locally

## “Deep” forensic considerations (where it gets serious)

### Timestamp manipulation (timestomping)

- Modified timestamps without changing content
    
- Detected via:
    
    - Mismatch between file system metadata and app metadata
        
    - Log files
        
    - Shadow copies / backups
        

---

### Metadata persistence after deletion

- Deleted files often leave:
    
    - MFT entries
        
    - Journal records
        
    - Unallocated space artifacts
        
- Metadata may survive even when content is gone
    

---

### Anti-forensics & metadata wiping

- Tools that strip EXIF or document properties
    
- Signs of wiping:
    
    - Empty or default metadata
        
    - Inconsistent timestamps
        
    - Re-encoded media
        

---

### Correlation is key

Metadata alone is weak.  
**Metadata + logs + file content + user behavior = evidence**

Investigators rarely trust a single metadata source.

- **Autopsy / Sleuth Kit**
    
- **EnCase**
    
- **FTK**
    
- **X-Ways**
    
- **Volatility** (memory metadata)
    
- **Plaso / log2timeline** (timeline correlation)
