## üêç 1. **Introduction to Python**

### ‚úÖ What is Python?

**Python** is a **high-level, interpreted** programming language known for its **easy-to-read syntax** and **versatility**. It is widely used in:

* Web Development
* Cybersecurity
* Data Science
* Automation
* AI/ML

---

### ‚úÖ Why Learn Python for Cybersecurity?

* üõ† Used in **automation** (scripts, tools, payloads)
* üîç Great for **penetration testing** (like with tools such as `scapy`, `nmap`, `requests`)
* üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Helpful in writing **custom scanners**, **log parsers**, etc.

### ‚úÖ Python Features:

| Feature        | Description                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Easy Syntax    | Looks like English            |
| Interpreted    | No compilation needed         |
| Cross-platform | Runs on Linux, Windows, macOS |
| Huge Libraries | For web, hacking, data, etc.  |
| Open-source    | Free to use                   |

### ‚úÖ First Python Program

```python
# This is a comment
print("Hello, Cybersecurity World!")
```

### ‚ñ∂ Output:

```
Hello, Cybersecurity World!
```

### ‚úÖ Python Syntax Basics:

| Concept   | Example                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Variables | `x = 10`                            |
| Strings   | `name = "cythom"`                   |
| Numbers   | `marks = 95.5`                      |
| Booleans  | `is_logged_in = True`               |
| Comments  | `# This is a comment`               |
| Input     | `name = input("Enter your name: ")` |
| Print     | `print("Welcome", name)`            |

---

### ‚úÖ Basic Data Types:

```python
x = 5           # int
y = 3.14        # float
name = "cythom" # str
is_hacker = True # bool
```

---

### ‚úÖ Simple Cyber Example:

Check if a password is weak:

```python
password = input("Enter password: ")

if len(password) < 8:
    print("Weak password: Too short!")
else:
    print("Looks good.")
```
