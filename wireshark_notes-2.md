# Wireshark Tutorial for BEGINNERS-2
# 🧠 Cyber Security for Beginners – Deep & Detailed Notes

## 📘 CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION TO CYBER SECURITY

### 🔹 What is Cyber Security?
Cyber Security is the practice of protecting:
- Computers
- Networks
- Mobile Devices
- Electronic Systems
- Servers
- Data
from malicious attacks or unauthorized access.

**🔑 Goal:** Ensure the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA triad) of data.

### 🔹 Why Cyber Security is Important?
- **📱 Digital Transformation:** Everything is online — shopping, banking, social media, etc.
- **🛡️ Increasing Cyber Threats:** Rise in malware, phishing, ransomware, DDoS attacks, etc.
- **🏢 Organizational Risk:** Breaches cause reputation loss, financial damage, legal issues.

**Real-world impact:** Attacks on Facebook, LinkedIn, government portals.

### 🔹 Common Misconception
- ❌ Myth: Cyber Security is only about hacking
- ✅ Truth: It's a vast field involving:
  - Security policies
  - Risk management
  - Threat detection
  - Incident response & recovery
  - Compliance & governance

## 📘 CHAPTER 2: TYPES OF CYBER SECURITY

### 🔐 1. Network Security
- Protect internal networks from intrusions (malware, DoS)
- Uses: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs

### 🖥️ 2. Application Security
- Secure software from vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, CSRF)
- Tools: Code Review, Static/Dynamic Analysis

### ☁️ 3. Cloud Security
- Secure cloud platforms (AWS, Azure)
- Involves: IAM, encryption, compliance monitoring

### 📁 4. Information Security (InfoSec)
- Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data
- Covers digital and physical data

### 👨‍💼 5. Operational Security (OpSec)
- Define access controls, procedures for handling data

### 🧠 6. End-user Education
- Humans are the weakest link
- Teach users to avoid phishing, malicious links, etc.
