---

## 📋 Introduction
- Overview of Wireshark’s role in network troubleshooting and security.
- Discussion of how packet-level analysis provides insight unreachable through higher-level tools.

---

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
1. **Installing Wireshark**
   - Download and install on Windows/Mac/Linux platforms.
   - Remember: on Windows, installing WinPcap/Npcap is critical for live capture.

2. **Interface Selection**
   - Choose the right network interface (Ethernet / Wi‑Fi / loopback) depending on capture needs.
   - Tips on enabling promiscuous mode and setting up capture filters to reduce noise.

---

## 👀 Capturing Traffic
- Launching a new capture session—using capture filters (e.g., `tcp port 80`) to focus.
- Difference between capture and display filters.

---

## 🧩 Packet Structure Deep Dive
- Structure breakdown: Ethernet → IP → TCP/UDP → Application layer.
- Importance of the packet list, packet details, and packet bytes panes.
- How to read flags, sequence numbers, checksums, etc.

---

## 🔍 Display & Color Filters
- Filtering HTTP conversation: `http`, `ip.addr == 192.168.1.10`.
- Color coding: default rules (TCP handshake, errors); customizing colors for quick visual scanning.

---

## 🧠 TCP Analysis
- Following TCP streams to reconstruct full conversations.
- Detecting anomalies: retransmissions, out-of-order packets, duplicate ACKs.

---

## 🌐 Protocol Decoding
- Built‑in support: DNS, HTTP, TLS, VoIP, etc.
- Decoding encrypted sessions: importing SSL/TLS keys to decrypt HTTPS traffic.

---

## 📈 IO Graphs & Statistics
- Generating flow-based statistics: packet count, bytes per time unit.
- Protocol hierarchy view: identify top talkers and protocols in use.

---

## 🛠 Advanced Use Cases
1. **VoIP Troubleshooting**
   - Using RTP stream statistics to check quality metrics (Jitter, Packet Loss).
2. **Security Analysis**
   - Spotting unusual patterns: ARP spoofing, DNS tunneling, brute-force attacks.

---

## 💡 Best Practices & Tips
- Always label and timestamp captures.
- Export important conversations as PCAP for long-term storage.
- Use profiles for quick workspace switching (e.g. VoIP vs. Web dev).
- Update capture filters to focus on only what's necessary.

---

## 📑 Resources & Resources Mentioned
- Official Wireshark documentation and wiki.
- Sample PCAP repositories for additional practice.

---

## ✅ Summary Takeaways
- Wireshark gives full visibility into network traffic at Layer 2–7.
- Mastering filters and stream following is essential for diagnosis.
- Advanced analysis features support both troubleshooting and security tasks.
