## 🔎 Introduction
- Emphasizes Wireshark's utility in diagnosing real-world network problems.
- Covers a range of scenarios: performance degradation, authentication failures, network loops, etc.

---

## 🧪 Scenario 1: Slow HTTP Performance
1. Capture HTTP traffic with filter `tcp.port == 80`.
2. Identify long download times via time delta in packet list.
3. Use “Follow TCP Stream” to see application-level delays.
4. Look for:
   - HTTP 1.1 keep-alive behavior
   - Delayed ACKs, window scaling issues
5. Inspect round-trip time (RTT) stats—frequent retries point to congestion.

---

## 🛡️ Scenario 2: DNS Resolution Failures
1. Filter with `dns`.
2. Spot repeated queries for the same domain without reply.
3. Check for malformed responses, timeouts, truncated packets.
4. Verify DNS server IPs are correct and reachable.

---

## 🔑 Scenario 3: Authentication/Access Issues (Kerberos/LDAP)
1. Apply protocol filters: `kerberos` and `ldap`.
2. Follow respective streams to check protocol flow.
3. Look for failures: `KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED`, `LDAP referral not found`, etc.
4. Compare malformed vs. valid responses to isolate errors.

---

## 🌀 Scenario 4: Broadcast Storm or Network Loop
1. Use filter `arp or (eth.dst == ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff)`.
2. Observe repeated ARP requests or traffic flooding.
3. Identify duplicate MAC addresses or switches without spanning tree protocol (STP).
4. Trace physical path using switch port mappings (requires documentation).

---

## 🧨 Scenario 5: High Latency or Packet Loss on TCP
1. Filter `tcp`.
2. Inspect TCP statistics:
   - Retransmissions
   - Dup ACKs
   - Out-of-order packets
3. View TCP analysis flags: “Fast Retransmission,” “Keep-Alive”
4. Use IO graphs to observe spikes in retransmit events.

## 📊 Statistical Tools & Visualizations
- **IO Graphs**: visualize packet/byte rates over time.
- **TCP Stream Graphs**: “Round Trip Time,” “Throughput.”
- **Protocol Hierarchy**: identify buckets by protocol usage.
- **Endpoints & Conversations**: find top talkers and heavy traffic.

---

## 🛠 Advanced Troubleshooting Tips
- Always use descriptive file naming and consistent timestamps.
- Export streams/packets (PCAP) for sharing or deeper offline analysis.
- Build multiple GUI profiles for different tasks (e.g., DNS, VoIP, Security).
- Use custom coloring rules to highlight anomalies.
- Apply capture filters at live time to cut noise, not only display filters later.

---

## ✅ Summary — Key Takeaways
- **Start from symptoms** → choose appropriate filter.
- **Follow streams** to view full dialogue.
- **Inspect TCP behavior** (RTT, retransmits) for performance issues.
- **Use built-in stats/graphs** to validate observations.
- **Document and share** results with screenshots and PCAP exports.

## 📂 Recommended Practices
| Tip | Explanation |
|-----|-------------|
| Name captures clearly | e.g., `2025-06-13_DNS-failure.pcap` |
| Maintain filter presets | save complexity for frequent tasks |
| Use notes and metadata | store findings and suspected root causes |
| Archive critical captures | reference historical data for recurring issues |
